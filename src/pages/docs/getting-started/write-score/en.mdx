## ORIGINAL

For ORIGINAL, you can edit the score yourself.

## COPY

In the case of COPY, no one is the administrator, so it is necessary to perform diff management.
If you are a programmer, it is easy to understand if you imagine Github and so on.

1. Creating a Pull

   Once you create a pull, you can copy the state of the score at the time of creation and edit it as you wish.

2. Writing a Score in a Pull

   Pulls allow you to add new scores and correct mistakes.

3. Publish the PullRequet

   - If there are only a few contributors, you can merge them yourself.
   - If there are multiple contributors, a vote is held.
     The voting period is automatically determined by the number of contributors,
     If there are too many "yes" votes, the file is merged; if there are too many "no" votes, the file is put into draft status.

4. Merging a Pull

   When a pull is merged, the changes made in the pull are reflected in the source score.
